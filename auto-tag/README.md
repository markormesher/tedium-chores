# Chore: Auto-Tag

This [Tedium](https://github.com/markormesher/tedium) chore auto-tags new releases using [semver-tagger](https://github.com/markormesher/semver-tagger).

Note that this chore requires access the platform token, which is done by setting `exposePlatformToken: true` in the chore config.
